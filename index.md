## Dean's fast.ai Blog

Welcome to my journey through fast.ai! I want to use this blog to:

1. Familiarize myself with Jupyter Notebooks - writing posts with notebooks will be a good way to become comfortable in this environment.
2. Make note of interesting things - I find myself losing motivation when participating in courses often, and I think one reason is that I don't keep track of what I've learned. Being able to revisit interesting paths and thoughts that I've had will help keep me motivated.
3. Accountability - Writing these posts will expose any weak points that I have in a lesson, where I may have skimmed over an important topic, or may not have built a solid foundation for a specific part of the lesson.
