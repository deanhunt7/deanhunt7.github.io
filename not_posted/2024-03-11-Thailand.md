Just wanted to collect my thoughts about the muay thai experience I had in Thailand.

### scared
At first, I was really scared of everyone. People there were seriously some of the toughest people I've ever met. They also weren't the most friendly types of people at all times, which made them even scarier. I was coming off of at least two months of literally no physical activity apart from walking, so that made it more intimidating for me. The first few classes didn't even really help this issue much, since it was hard to talk with people during training, and everyone was too tired to socialize much afterwards. Making friends in the camp made all the difference in the world, and made it so much easier to go to trainings every day, especially when I was on the verge of skipping. It also made the sparring rounds more fun when I could spar with people I knew.

I was also really scared of sparring. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that I never got a mouthguard (an extremely stupid decision, in hindsight. Seriously one of the dumbest things I could have done). Because of this, I think I missed out on some of the biggest gains I could have had, all because I was scared about my teeth. I still don't think I understand the line between hard sparring and ego sparring, and I'm not sure the proper etiquette to tell the other person they're going a bit too hard. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure when someone is going too hard, vs when I'm just uncomfortable. Uncomfortable is good, and normal - it isn't fun to have someone punching and kicking you. Hopefully this comes with time and experience.

### conditioning
I think I wish I had gone to Thailand with more physical conditioning. A lot of time was spent making my legs stronger; I could hardly kick the bag without my shins really hurting at the beginning. The length of the practices were also pretty tough starting from zero, which made the initial humps larger to get over. I also felt weird sitting out parts of training, which in retrospect would have been a good idea at times. As it was, I left in great physical condition, but I think my Muay Thai specific skills would have gotten more attention if I hadn't had to spend so much time building up my physical foundations.

One thing I vividly remember is how tired my shoulders would get from holding up my gloves for so long. It didn't really get that much better over time, either. Trainers would tell me to relax my shoulders and not stay too tense, but even when I followed that advice that was always the muscle most tired during training. I have noticed in the gym that my shoulders are comparatively weak to the rest of my body, so it made sense. This actually was way worse than aerobic exertion during training for me. I don't remember breathing extremely hard ever, but I do remember barely being able to hold my hands up while doing pad work or sparring.

### trainers
The trainers were pretty good here. I'm much more happy with the amount of input they give in Thailand while we're shadowboxing or sparring vs what I've experienced in Korea. Some of the most helpful times were when the trainers would come up during shadowboxing and help hone your strikes a bit more. They were also super playful with the students. Actually, messing with them was one guaranteed way to get some extra attention. During shadowboxing, sometimes I would throw a kick at a passing trainer, who would then come roast my technique a bit.

Different trainers had different styles, so you might be corrected on technique 3 different ways by 3 different trainers. I found it useful to just pick the style I wanted, and ignore advice that I knew was just based on personal preference. Otherwise, I often forgot the underlying technique mechanics and got lost in the weeds. The trainers were great at keeping morale up, and the noises they would make during training will stay with me forever. That was one of my favorite parts of training in Thailand.

### now
I've noticed a few big changes here in Korea after training in Thailand. The biggest one is my kicking power and speed. I'm so much faster with my kicks, and they feel like they have a lot more power behind them than they did last year. I definitely still have a long ways to go in terms of hip mobility and using them more while kicking, but I have a much better foundation now. I'm also able to kick the bag without shin pain, which is amazing. That was the hardest part about practicing kicks - I couldn't really ever practice more than a few at at time before my shin hurt too much to kick more.

I haven't sparred yet here in Korea, but I have a feeling that it's going to feel quite slow and easy compared to what we did in Thailand. I remember even last year Koreans would complain about my kicks, which I was really bad at controlling. I'll have to pay attention to this when I get into sparring to make sure people still want to spar with me after a few weeks. I'm not saying I'm too strong now, just that I'm not great at controlling strikes and I'm worried I'll go too hard for Korean sparring levels.

It does feel great to walk into the gym and feel comfortable with everything, to understand what's going on and be able to participate at a higher level than I was participating at. I think this will continue to improve the more gyms that I go to and the more experience I gain.

### other
Thailand was the best place I've ever lived. I've never been so happy or felt so much freedom. I'm going back one day.
