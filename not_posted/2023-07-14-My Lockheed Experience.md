I've had a lot of fun at my internship. However, I'm afraid I haven't learned very much over the summer. I'm going to take the time here to lay out what I have learned and what I wish I had done better (and what I'll change in these last few weeks).

# what I've learned

Since I've primarily been working with C#, I've not learned very much with regards to the technical stuff I do every day. Even so, I'm going to try to make a list here.
- I've definitely solidified class structures and software architecture stuff from working with the backend code so much. It's been interesting working with a full system, even if I haven't really been having to make a lot of the design decisions (since Dave created most of the design beforehand).
- I've learned a lot about working with a customer who actually cares what you're doing. It's helped me decide what's important and what isn't. I think I have a much better sense of what's important and what isn't from this internship. This is pretty important to me; I feel like not knowing what is important and what isn't is one of the primary causes of failure. Focusing more on the things that matter allow you to progress with less effort wasted.
- The coolest stuff I've learned has been with Kalman filters and sensor fusion as a whole. I'm worried about being railroaded, but I think it's definitely applicable to other situations. Learning about sensor fusion in general and what it means to "filter" was definitely helpful, and I even got a bit of practice implementing a kalman filter.
- I've probably learned the most about the defense industry as a whole. I have a good sense of what the industry is like (unclass, anyways) and how projects are managed, and how the money flows. I understand motivations behind a lot of decisions a lot better now in the defense world. I'm not sure if I want to stay in defense (definitely not in the slow-moving part), but it could definitely be useful knowledge.
- I've learned some about delegating tasks and working with difficult people. I liked this more leadership role that I took on here, and I think I want to continue that.

# wish I'd done better

There are definitely a few things I wish I'd done better. As always, my regrets stem from things that I wish I had done, rather than things I regret having done. It mostly comes down to opportunity costs. I'm usually regretting having done something because I didn't do something else instead, which might have been better for me.

- I wish I had focused a lot more on getting more AI/ML tasking. This is probably the biggest regret I have now, but luckily I can still start pressing that. I should have been more squeaky with Harrison or Ric, or even Dave. Unfortunately, Dave was gone for more than half of my internship, but while he was there (and when he comes back!) I should have/will press him more. I think that's the most useful thing I can get out of this internship.

Now that I think about it, I think this is the major regret I have with regards to the internship. I'm not too sad I didn't spend too much time touring fw or anything like that; I was doing other things that I definitely considered more important. All things considered, this isn't too bad, because I can still hop on this and at least partially fix what I'm regretting right now.
